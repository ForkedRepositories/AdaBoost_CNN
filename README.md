# AdaBoost-CNN: An Adaptive Boosting algorithm for Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Multi-Class Imbalanced datasets using Transfer Learning

For All use of the data, please 'cite' the following:

'Taherkhani A., Cosma G., McGinnity T.M. AdaBoost-CNN: An Adaptive Boosting algorithm for Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Multi-Class Imbalanced datasets using Transfer Learning, Neurocomputing'

# How to run

-To run the AdaBoost-CNN and a single CNN on the synthetic data run ‘test2_CNN.py’.

-The code will generate random synthetic data, and it trains and tests the two methods (AdaBoost-CNN and a single CNN) on this data.

-The variable ‘n_estimators’ before ‘Ada_CNN’ has been set to 10. It determines the number of estimators in the AdaBoost-CNN.

-The variable ‘epoch’ sets the number of training epochs of a CNN estimator in the AdaBoost-CNN.
