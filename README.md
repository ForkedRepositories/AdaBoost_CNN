# AdaBoost_CNN

To run the AdaBoost-CNN and a single CNN on the synthetic data run ‘test2_CNN.py’. The code will generate random synthetic data, and it trains and tests the two methods (AdaBoost-CNN and a single CNN) on this data.
-The variable ‘n_estimators’ before ‘Ada_CNN’ has been set to 10. It determines the number of estimators in the AdaBoost-CNN.
-The variable ‘epoch’ sets the number of training epochs of a CNN estimator in the AdaBoost-CNN.
